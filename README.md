# 3d-printed-eeg-electrodes

These electrode designs were developed within the scope of the [IASB] curricular unit of the 1st Year/2nd Semester of the [Master in Biomedical Engineering] at [Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa]. The full report on the performance of these electrodes can also be consulted in this repository (**recommended**).

##### Developed by: 
 - **[Diogo Antunes]**
 - **[Pedro Osório]**

We based our designs on one from [S. Krachunov et Al] which was for a 3D printed EEG electrode with **conductive coating**. Since our designs were aimed for a coatless solution, we made some relevant changes which are depicted in Figure 1.

**Figure 1** - Designs from [S. Krachunov et Al] (above) and the ones made by us (_eegelectrodev2.stl_).

The adjustments consisted of reducing the length of the spikes to minimize its resistivity and rounding its tips for a better hair penetration. Note that this design includes a 4mm snap that is compatible with the same snap-on connector cables used for the [H124SG electrodes].

The conductive PLA in use is called [Protopasta].

In addition to this design we also provide a earlier version without the rounded ended spikes, _EEG_electrode.stl_ .

**If you end up using our design please do not forget to reference us by linking [this repository].**

Thank you, and have fun experimenting! If you come up with new ideas for these designs feel free to suggest a pull and/or contact us.
